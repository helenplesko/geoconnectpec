    <h3>Software Solutions</h3>

	<p> Organizations like The County Foundation consist of diverse individuals performing various roles and tasks. User types offer a versatile method for individuals to acquire licenses for the necessary capabilities and applications they require in either ArcGIS Enterprise or ArcGIS Online.  Since the client has minimal experience using Esri products ArcGIS Online is recommended for new users and is a secure SaaS platform without complex setups like in 
		ArcGIS Enterprise.Within which the Creator account, in particular, includes 11 essential apps (including ArcGIS Dashboard, ArcGIS Hub Basics, and 
		others), four field apps (including ArcGIS Survey123, ArcGIS Workforce, and others), and three office apps (including ArcGIS for SharePoint, ArcGIS for Excel, and ArcGIS for Teams). The only additional app that is needed is Community Analyst. Moreover, 
		The County Foundation has qualified for Esri Nonprofit Program, providing them with discounts on software and training.</p>

    <h3>Symbolizing</h3>

    <p>When symbolizing the layers in ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS Online, Cynthia Brewer's "ColorBrewer2.0" was used to choose color ramps that are accessible to those with colorblindness. 
        The Chrome Extension "Colorblindly" was also used to simulate different types of colorblindness. 
		Creating the solutions with accessibility in mind allows for the products to reach a wider audience.</p>

    <h3>Housing Suitability Analysis</h3>
	<p> This Housing Suitability was conducted on ArcGIS Pro using Multi-Criteria Decision Analytic Hierarchy Process to determine the Suitable area for Hosuing </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Distance to Water network</li>
		<li>Distance to Social Infrastructure</li>
		<li>Distance to Road network</li>

    <h3>Least Cost Path Analysis</h3>

	<p>A least cost path analysis was conducted in ArcGIS Pro using a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis Analytic Hierarchy Process to determine three potential on-demand transit routes. 
		The routes were:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Picton to Northport</li>
			<li>Bloomfield to North Marysburgh</li>
			<li>Bloomfield to South Marysburgh</li>
		</ul>
	<p>The criteria involved were:</p>

    <h3>Interactive Web Applications in ArcGIS Online</h3>

    <p>After symbolizing the layers in ArcGIS Pro, the layers were shared as a web layer to ArcGIS Online, where they were brought into Map Viewer to create interactive web maps. 
        Then they were brought into ArcGIS Dashboards, as well as an ArcGIS Experience Builder and ArcGIS Hub. 
        These products contained many elements to elevate the user experience, including:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Images, maps, graphs, charts, text, legends, and more.</li>
        <li>Pop-ups with charts, field lists, and text.</li>
        <li>As zoom extent of map changes, the indicators, lists, and pie charts change as well.</li>
        <li>When a pie chart slice is clicked, the features on the map are filtered.</li>
        <li>When a dissemination area is clicked on one map, it flashes on the other to let the user know which area it corresponds to.</li>
        <li>Instructions on how to use the features within the Dashboard and Experience Builder.</li>
    </ul>

	<p>For step-by-step instructions on how each web application was made, please see the next section on Documentation.</p>

    <h3>Ongoing Documentation</h3>

    <p>Each member of Team HRS kept individual record of metadata and methodology throughout the project duration. 
		Later, this information was compiled into three separate documents within a shared folder on OneDrive. 
        These documents were initially created to help The County Foundation staff replicate the steps to manipulate data and create web applications in ArcGIS Online, but they are also useful for anyone else new to ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS Online.
