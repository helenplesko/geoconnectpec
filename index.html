	<h3>The County Foundation</h3>
	<p>The County Foundation is a Canadian community foundation located in Prince Edward County, Ontario. 
	They manage three key components of the county: community grants, collaborative action, and Vital Signs data. 
	Through these three areas, The County Foundation has made, and continues to make, incredible contributions to PEC to better the well-being of the community.</p>

	<h3>Vital Signs</h3>
	<p>The County Foundation’s Vital Signs program aims to improve the quality of life and increase the sense of belonging of those living and visiting PEC through analysis of community-driven data. 
	It provides reports, summaries, resources, and data for the public based on nine key themes: community, economy, education, environment, food security, health, housing, safety, and transportation. </p>

	<h2>About the Project</h2>
	
	<h3>Description of Project</h3>
	<p>GIS Collaborative Project #2409 involves the use of Esri products to effectively display community-driven data to expand The County Foundation’s Vital Signs program's existing resources and aid in decision-making for Prince Edward County.</p>
	
	<h3>Project Abstract</h3>
	<p>The County Foundation is a nonprofit organization in Prince Edward County, Ontario. 
		Their Vital Signs program provides reports and summaries of community-driven data for the public to improve the quality of life and increase the sense of belonging of those living and visiting Prince Edward County. 
		The organization wishes to expand this program's resources in the form of meaningful geospatial data that reflect the key themes of transportation, community, education, housing, and environment. 
		Team HRS is working with The County Foundation to provide them with geospatial data using Esri software to effectively display and analyze demographics, social connectivity, public transit, and social infrastructure of the rural community. 
		The three main objectives to meet this goal are: (1) provide the client with software solutions and community data; (2) enhance geographic data analysis and visualization for effective decision-making relating to housing and public transit; and (3) maximize geographic information system efficiency through user role definition, metadata creation, training, and ArcGIS Hub establishment. 
		The objectives are met by preparing feature layers containing data related to Vital Signs’ key themes, conducting spatial analyses for demographics, housing infrastructure, and potential transit routes, configuring ArcGIS Online web maps, Dashboards and Experiences, customizing an ArcGIS Hub, and preparing instructional and metadata documentation. 
		The population of Prince Edward County is expected to increase, housing is most suitable in 18.7% of the study area, and three potential routes for on-demand transit connecting rural communities were created. 
		Further analyses include comparing the potential transit routes to the transportation plans of neighboring regions to determine the best practice for the county. 
		The project was carried out with user accessibility, Esri licensing, and resources in mind, and ultimately succeeded in strengthening rural connections and identifying access barriers in Prince Edward County.
