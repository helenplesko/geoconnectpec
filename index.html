	<h3>Vital Signs®</h3>
	<p>The County Foundation’s Vital Signs® program aims to improve the quality of life and increase the sense of belonging of those living and visiting PEC through analysis of community-driven data. 
	It provides reports, summaries, resources, and data for the public based on nine key themes: community, economy, education, environment, food security, health, housing, safety, and transportation. </p>

	<h2>About the Project</h2>
	
	<h3>Description of Project</h3>
	<p>GIS Collaborative Project #2409 involves the use of Esri products to effectively display community-driven data to expand The County Foundation’s Vital Signs® program's existing resources and aid in decision-making for Prince Edward County.</p>
	
	<h3>Project Abstract</h3>
	<p>The County Foundation is a nonprofit organization in Prince Edward County, Ontario. Their Vital Signs® program provides reports and summaries of community-driven data for the public to improve the quality of life and increase the sense of belonging of those living and visiting Prince Edward County. 
	The organization wishes to expand this program's resources in the form of meaningful geospatial data that reflect the key themes of community, education, and housing, and environment. 
	Team HRS is working with The County Foundation to provide them with geospatial data using Esri software to effectively display and analyze demographics, social connectivity, and social infrastructure of the rural community. 
	The three main objectives to meet this goal are: (1) provide the client with software solutions and community data; (2) enhance geographic data analysis and visualization for effective decision-making; and (3) maximize Geographic Information System efficiency through user role definition, metadata creation, training, and ArcGIS Hub establishment. 
	The objectives are met by producing feature layers containing census, environment, broadband, and social infrastructure data, web maps hosted in ArcGIS Online and viewed in ArcGIS Community Analyst, interactive ArcGIS Dashboards, a customized ArcGIS Hub, documentation of the methodology, and metadata of all products. 
	The deliverables are created with user experience, Esri licensing, resources, timeline, and risks in mind, and ultimately succeed in strengthening rural connections, identifying access barriers, and elevating a sense of belonging in Prince Edward County.</p>
